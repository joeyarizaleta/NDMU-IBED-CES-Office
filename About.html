                The Community Extension Services (CES) at Notre Dame of Marbel University-Integrated Basic Education Department (NDMU-IBED) embodies the institution's commitment to fostering socially aware and engaged students. Rooted in the Marist tradition and Catholic social teachings, CES initiatives aim to build progressive, healthy, educated, and empowered communities through various outreach programs.

            <h2><p><strong>Core Objectives and Activities</strong></p></h2>
            <ul>
                <p><strong>Educational Outreach:</strong> Implementing programs like the Alternative Learning System (ALS) to provide basic education to out-of-school youth and adults, especially in marginalized communities.</p>
                <p><strong>Community Development:</strong> Engaging students in community-based projects that address local needs, such as literacy programs, health and wellness initiatives, and environmental conservation efforts.</p>
                <p><strong>Capacity Building:</strong> Conducting seminars, workshops, and training sessions to empower community members with skills and knowledge for sustainable development.</p>
            </ul>

            <h2><p><strong>Institutional Support and Partnerships</strong></p></h2>
            <p>
                The CES operates under the guidance of the Office of Community Extension Services, ensuring that programs align with the university's mission and values. Collaboration with local government units, non-governmental organizations, and other stakeholders enhances the reach and impact of CES activities.
            </p>

            <h2><p><strong>Student Involvement</strong></p></h2>
            <p>
                Students from various levels actively participate in CES programs, fostering a sense of social responsibility and real-world application of classroom learning. Recent activities include community visits and service projects in areas like Sitio Takilay, where students engage directly with residents to address specific community needs.
            </p>

            <p>
                Through these comprehensive efforts, NDMU-IBED's Community Extension Services not only contribute to community upliftment but also instill in students the values of compassion, service, and civic engagement.
